# Ghostline

Ghostline is a delay plugin built around echoes, space, and movement. It is designed to create atmosphere, depth, and trails that feel alive rather than perfectly controlled.

Ghostline is an open-source project created for producers and developers who enjoy shaping space as much as sound.

## Features

- Delay processing focused on atmosphere and movement
- Designed for subtle space or deep, haunting echoes
- Simple controls with creative range
- Lightweight and responsive
- Built for experimentation and sound design

Ghostline is not about perfect repeats. It is about what lingers.

---

## Philosophy

Ghostline was built around one idea:

Sound should leave a trace.

Some delays sit politely in the background. Ghostline is meant to drift, smear, and fade in unpredictable ways. It works best when it is felt as much as it is heard.

If the echoes feel too clean, push it.  
If the space feels empty, let it breathe.

## Final Note

Ghostline is meant to fade, drift, and return.

Let echoes overlap.
Let space grow.
Let silence speak between repeats.

Use your ears and trust the atmosphere.
